---Folders---
handout - Assignment description and documentation

---Executables---
./testscript - A simple bash script for running a few sample test cases
./pi - A simple program for statistically calculating pi
./pi-sched - A simple program for statistically calculating pi using
             a specific scheduling policy
./rw - A simple i/o bound example program.
./rr_quantum - A simple program for determing the RR quantum.

---Examples---
Build:
 make

Clean:
 make clean

pi:
 ./pi
 ./pi <Number of Iterations>

pi-sched:
 ./pi-sched
 ./pi-sched <Number of Iterations>
 ./pi-sched <Number of Iterations> <Scheduling Policy>

rw:
 ./rw
 ./rw <#Bytes to Write to Output File>
 ./rw <#Bytes to Write to Output File> <Block Size>
 ./rw <#Bytes to Write to Output File> <Block Size> <Input Filename>
 ./rw <#Bytes to Write to Output File> <Block Size> <Input Filename> <Output Filename>

testscript:
 ./testscript

rr_quantum:
 sudo ./rr_quantum


 WHAT WE NEED TO GET FOR RAHAT: 

 1. Real time -> Finish - start time
 2. System Time -> Amount of time spent in the kernel 
 3. User time -> Time spent in user space 
 4. Waitime -> Amount of time spent waiting. 
 5. # of context switches 

 to get this info, call GNU time in /usr/bin/time -v NOTE: this is different than $time in shell because we get more info. 

 Example:sudo /usr/bin/time -v ./pi 1000 {SCHED_RR, SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_OTHER}

 Notes: TO get wait time = Realtime - (System time + user time)
 		SCHED_OTHER is CFS by default. 


 C code for the scheduler:

 #include <sched.h> 
 //contains all of the metainfo for a program 
 sched_param param; 
 //this actually sets the priority 
 param.priority(sched_getpriority_max(policy));
 //this sets the scheduler on the pid 0 with the parameter for the scheduler pased in. 
 sched_setschduler(0,SCHED_RR,&param);
