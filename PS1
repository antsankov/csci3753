Problem Set 1
Cristobal Salazar

1) When a user is in user mode, he/she has limited access to certain areas of memory, and can only run a limited set of commands. When in user mode, the user cannot write to certain files, run certain commands at the command line, or even read from certain areas of memory, all for security reasons. In kernal mode, a user can access all files and hardware, and can run all commands/code on a given system. While in kernal mode, a user can read or write to any file, anywhere in memory, but this also means that he/she can run malicious commands/code as well. An operating system needs both modes because priveledged users/the CPU needs to be able to run important low-level commands/code, such as scheduling processes and managing other parts of the OS. But some users and applications may not need this kind of access, or we may not want them to have such priviledged access, so they run in user mode.

2) It will take 20ms to complete all three programs. The machine can break down this task by running P0 and P1 in CPU1 using hyperthreading, taking, theoretically, less than 5ms+10ms. Then, in CPU2, the machine can task it to run P2, taking 20ms. So completing all 3 will take at most 20ms.

3) The expected value/average time it will take to access a word is going to be equal to (1)(.95)+(.05)(11)(.99)+(.01)(.05)(10000011) = 5001.50ns.
That is, the probability of retrieving from cache(.95) times the number of ns(1) plus the probability we will miss in cache(.05) times the probability of a hit in RAM(.99) times the number of ns for cache&RAM(11) plus the probability of a miss in RAM(.01) times the probability of a miss in cache(.05) times the number of ns for cache&RAM&disk(10000011).

4)At the command line, run ":(){ :|:& };:"
When run, my machine slowed down then froze completely, meaning the machine crashed.
